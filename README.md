# first-web-page
First of all, I would like to thank @[Atabord](https://github.com/Atabord) for mentoring me during this process and for being so patient.

This is the first statics webpage I built. In each section I tried to learn and implement something new for mew, for instance, the index page, is basic HTML, basic CSS and basic JS. On the Questionnaire page, I took bootstrap for a spin, I tried its different options and also made an effort to make my job a bit entertaining. Next is the Payments section, in this one I dove deep into CSS, I used a tutorial for this card, but I tried to implement it with a few twists, such as the rotation of the card (on the original tutorial it was done on hover), I wanted to have something beautiful yet useful, so I made a short JS function to implement the rotation of the card only when the card itself (not the input fields) is clicked, as with everything I do, I tried to have some fun and decided to include a small "joke" on the footer of the page. Finally, on the "While making this website..." section I wanted to make a reminder for myself of how the process felt for me at the time, and the struggles I had with it, I made it with basic JS since I will be diving deeper into it in the future, and I didn't want to rush it.
