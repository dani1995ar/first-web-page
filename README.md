# first-web-page
First of all I would like to thank @[Atabord](https://github.com/Atabord) for mentoring me during this process and for being so patient.
I will use this section to describe a bit of the process of creating my first web page in case anyone from CS50x might be interested.
for now though I'd like to just say that if you are undertaking the course and having doubts about how to do X or Y thing or how to implement a feature
don't feel afraid to google it and use the responses you find AS LONG AS YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON, and as long as you are able to modify the existing solution
to fit your specific needs.
